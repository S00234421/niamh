                    Ireland is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe. 
                    It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. 
                    Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.
                    Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. 
                    As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7 million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.

                <h3>Prehistoric Ireland</h3>
                <p>
                    During the last glacial period, and until about 16,000 BC, much of Ireland was periodically covered in ice. 
                    The relative sea level was less than 50m lower resulting in an ice bridge  forming between Ireland and Great Britain.
                    By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern Ireland and Scotland and by 12,000 BC Ireland was completely separated from Great Britain.
                    Later, around 6100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe.
                    Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in County Clare.
                    Since 2021, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland is dated to 33,000 years ago.
                    By about 8000 BC, more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island

                <h3>Norman and English invasions</h3>
                <img class="showimages" src="images/norman_english_invasions.jpeg" id="showimages"/>
                <p>
                    On 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford. 
                    It was led by Richard de Clare, known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer.
                    The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster.
                    In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou, France, following a war involving Tighearnán Ua Ruairc, of Breifne, and sought the assistance of the Angevin King Henry II, in recapturing his kingdom. 
                    In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. 
                    Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.

                <h3>Union with Great Britain</h3>
                <img class="showimages" src="images/union_with_great_britain.jpeg" id="showimages"/>
                <p>
                    In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. 
                    Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.
                    The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. 
                    According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.
                    Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at Westminster in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by Robert Emmet's failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.
                    Aside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.

                <h3>Northern Ireland</h3>
                <img class="showimages" src="images/northern_ireland.jpeg" id="showimages"/>
                <p>
                    Northern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. 
                    Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941. 
                    Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the Republic of Ireland.
                    Edward Carson signing the Solemn League and Covenant in 1912, declaring opposition to Home Rule "using all means which may be found necessary"
                    Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. 
                    Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. 
                    The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by "first-past-the-post" from 1929) was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party. 
                    Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment.

                    A chef is a professional cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine. 
                    The word "chef" is derived from the term chef de cuisine, the director or head of a kitchen. 
                    Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.
                    There are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation. 
                    Examples include the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, and the chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production. 
                    The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word "chef" in their titles. 
                    Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. 
                    A chef's standard uniform includes a hat (called a toque), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).
                    Education is available from many culinary institutions offering diploma, associate, and bachelor's degree programs in culinary arts. 
                    Depending on the level of education, this can take one to four years. 
                    An internship is often part of the curriculum. 
                    Regardless of the education received, most professional kitchens follow the apprenticeship system, and most new cooks will start at a lower-level 2nd or 1st cook position and work their way up.

                 <h3>Leinster</h3>
                 <section class="col_detail">

                    Leinster is one of the four provinces of Ireland, situated in the southeast and east of Ireland. 
                    The province comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Meath, Leinster and Osraige. 
                    Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic "fifths" of Leinster and Meath gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. 
                    The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. 
                    In later centuries, local government legislation has prompted further sub-division of the historic counties.
                    Leinster has no official function for local-government purposes. 
                    However, it is an officially recognised subdivision of Ireland and is listed on ISO 3166-2 as one of the four provinces of Ireland. 
                    "IE-L" is attributed to Leinster as its country sub-division code. 
                    Leinster had a population of 2,858,501 according to the preliminary results of the 2022 census, making it the most populous province in the country.
                    The traditional flag of Leinster features a golden harp on a green background.

                    Ulster is one of the four traditional Irish provinces. 
                    It is made up of nine counties: six of these constitute Northern Ireland; the remaining three are in the Republic of Ireland.
                    It is the second-largest (after Munster) and second-most populous (after Leinster) of Ireland's four traditional provinces, with Belfast being its biggest city. 
                    Unlike the other provinces, Ulster has a high percentage of Protestants, making up almost half of its population. 
                    English is the main language and Ulster English the main dialect. 
                    A minority also speak Irish, and there are Gaeltachtaí (Irish-speaking regions) in southern County Derry, the Gaeltacht Quarter, Belfast, and in County Donegal; collectively, these three regions are home to a quarter of the total Gaeltacht population of Ireland.
                    Ulster-Scots is also spoken. 
                    Lough Neagh, in the east, is the largest lake in the British Isles, while Lough Erne in the west is one of its largest lake networks. 
                    The main mountain ranges are the Mournes, Sperrins, Croaghgorms and Derryveagh Mountains.

                    <p>
                        Connacht is one of the four provinces of Ireland, in the west of Ireland. Until the ninth century it consisted of several independent major Gaelic kingdoms (Uí Fiachrach, Uí Briúin, Uí Maine, Conmhaícne, and Delbhna).
                        Between the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg Mór (died 882) and his descendant, Aedh mac Ruaidri Ó Conchobair (reigned 1228–33), it became a kingdom under the rule of the Uí Briúin Aí dynasty, whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair. 
                        At its greatest extent, it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne, as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster. 
                        Two of its greatest kings, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156) and his son Ruaidri Ua Conchobair (c. 1115–1198) greatly expanded the kingdom's dominance, so much so that both became High King of Ireland.
